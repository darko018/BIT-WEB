<!-- Basics
● Create a simple HTML page with one paragraph
● Create a SCSS file and define style for that paragraph in it (bg and font size)
● Transpile the scss file to css file using sass (terminal command)
● Include transpiled css file in the HTML page
● Change some style in scss file and figure out how to get that change to
show on page -->

<!-- Basics with Watch Option
● Adapt the previous example to work with the watch option
● Create two directories “scss” and “css”
● In scss directory copy scss file from the previous exercise
● Start the transpiling process
● Make changes in the scss file and notice what is going on -->

<!-- Variables
● Take the “ID Card” project that we created in the first week
(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_cry3I2R3q7SHJtX3lOVUgybXM)
● Apply style to it and use variables for colors and width -->
