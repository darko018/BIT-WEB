    <!-- Inserting elements
    Start with a blank HTML page
    
    Using just JS (jQuery), create an image gallery
    All links to images in the gallery should be elements of the same array!
    
    When the gallery is created and visible on the page, create gallery title and insert it before the gallery images
    
    Go through gallery images and set a random size to each gallery image

    Bonus:
    Set a green border around each image whose width is less than 200px up until the first one that doesn't meet that requirement (i.e. when you get to the first img that is more than 200px wide, stop checking and setting green border). -->
